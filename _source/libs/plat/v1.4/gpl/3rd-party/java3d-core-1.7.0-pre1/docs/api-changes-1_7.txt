This document contains the proposed API changes to the Java 3D 1.7 API
that deviate from the 1.6 API:

I. Relocation of the javax.media package into org.jogamp to be consistent 
with the Maven group identifier and to avoid name clashes with the obsolete
versions of Java3D shipped with OS X and loaded as extensions.

II. Addition of a new pipeline org.jogamp.Jogl2es2pipeline see  /docs/GL2ES2Pipeline usage guide.md for usage.
