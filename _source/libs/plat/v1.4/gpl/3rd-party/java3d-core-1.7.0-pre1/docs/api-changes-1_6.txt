This document conatains proposed API changes to the Java 3D 1.6 API
that deviate from the 1.5 API.

This file must be updated to record the addition or deprecation of any
public or protected class, interface, field, constructor, or method to
the Java 3D API.

The one exception to this rule is that you don't need to update this
file when adding a non-final (i.e., virtual) method to a class if that
method--with exactly the same signature--already exists in a
superclass.  For example, adding a "toString" method to a j3d object
doesn't require an entry in this file.  Likewise, adding duplicateNode
or cloneNode methods to Node subclasses doesn't require an entry in
this file.

No incompatible changes to the Java 3D 1.5 API are allowed.


I. New/deprecated fields, constructors, methods

    <EXISTINGCLASS>
    ---------------
    New methods:
        public <NEWMETHOD>


II. Reparented classes

    <EXISTINGCLASS>
    ---------------
        <EXISTINGCLASS> now extends <NEWSUPERCLASS> (used to extend <OLDSUPERCLASS>)


III. New classes and interfaces (in javax.media.j3d)


IV. Deprecated classes and interfaces (in javax.media.j3d)
